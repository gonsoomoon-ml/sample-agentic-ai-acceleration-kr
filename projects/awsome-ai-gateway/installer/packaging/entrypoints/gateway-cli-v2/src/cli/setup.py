"""Step 4 — write Claude Code managed settings.

Writes gateway configuration to two locations:

1. ``managed-settings.json`` (the enterprise managed settings file — the single
   highest-priority tier, above CLI args, project/local and user settings).
   Deep-merged via :func:`cli.managed.write_gateway_settings`: our keys override,
   any org-provided keys are preserved. Requires admin/sudo.
   Contains: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, GATEWAY_CLI_GATEWAY_URL, OTEL env vars,
   apiKeyHelper, statusLine.

   Linux:     /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json
   Windows:   C:\\Program Files\\ClaudeCode\\managed-settings.json
   WSL:       /etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json when Claude Code is the
              native-Linux build; C:\\Program Files\\ClaudeCode\\... (via the
              /mnt/c mount) only when the Windows Claude Code binary is in use.
              See :func:`cli.managed._wsl_targets_windows_claude`.

   We target the primary managed-settings.json (not the managed-settings.d/
   drop-in) so our OTEL config is guaranteed to win over an org's pre-existing
   managed-settings.json — the ordering between the primary file and .d/
   fragments is undocumented. Caveat: an actual shell env var of the same name
   still beats any settings file; that is outside this tool's control.

2. ``~/.claude/settings.json`` (user settings, lower priority)
   Merged non-destructively. Contains: apiKeyHelper, model, OIDC env vars.

Keys written / updated (others are preserved):

  apiKeyHelper      — path to the api-key-helper binary (found next to the CLI or in PATH)
  model             — default model alias (claude-sonnet-4-6)
  env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL          — gateway-proxy URL (API calls)
  env.ADMIN_API_URL               — admin-api URL (primary key read by api-key-helper)
  env.GATEWAY_CLI_GATEWAY_URL     — admin-api URL (legacy alias — kept for backwards compat)
  env.OIDC_ISSUER_URL             — Cognito OIDC issuer (for api-key-helper OIDC mode)
  env.OIDC_CLIENT_ID              — Cognito app client id
  env.OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT — OTel collector endpoint (auto-derived as :80)
  env.OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL — http/protobuf
  env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY        — 1
  env.OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER              — otlp
  env.OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER               — otlp
  env.CLAUDE_CODE_ENHANCED_TELEMETRY_BETA — 1

Both files are snapshotted with a timestamped, non-overwriting backup before
they are modified (see ``cli.utils.backup``), so no pre-existing user or org
settings are ever lost — even across repeated ``setup`` runs.

    #     step-by-step removal guidance (User and System/admin scope) so the user
    #     can remove it themselves and confirm the change. The settings.json `env`
    #     block IS reconciled above (that file is ours to manage); the persistent
    #     OS definition is left for the user, guided by verify.
