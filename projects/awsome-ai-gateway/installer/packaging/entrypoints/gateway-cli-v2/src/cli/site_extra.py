"""Build-time custom-key injection (guideline 1-4).

An operator may need to inject their own keys into Claude Code's settings files
without editing Python. This module loads an optional ``site_extra.json`` that
is bundled into the build and deep-merges its two sections into the settings
files ``setup`` writes:

    {
      "managed": {          // deep-merged into managed-settings.json (highest tier)
        "env": { "HTTPS_PROXY": "http://proxy.example.com:8080" },
        "permissions": { "allow": ["Bash(git*)"] }
      },
      "user": {             // deep-merged into ~/.claude/settings.json
        "env": { "MY_TEAM_FLAG": "1" }
      }
    }

Precedence: the gateway-cli-owned keys (OTEL, ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, apiKeyHelper,
…) are applied *after* site-extra, so a site-extra value never silently breaks
gateway routing; every other key site-extra provides is merged in, org keys we
do not touch are preserved. All injected keys are recorded under the private
``_gatewayCli`` marker so ``disable`` unmerges them cleanly.

Where the file comes from
-------------------------
1. ``GATEWAY_CLI_SITE_EXTRA`` env var — explicit path (tests / ad-hoc override).
2. ``site_extra.json`` bundled next to this module (copied there at build time
   by ``build.ps1`` from ``packaging/site-extra.json``). Absent in a plain dev
   checkout, in which case injection is simply a no-op.
